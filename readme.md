Beemo Translate is a Chrome extension that translates selected text into different languages and gives possibility
to add your translation pair to your own vocabulary.
Install it from the [Chrome Webstore](unfortunately extension is on Chrome Store review).
This project is pretty young, but is made with love and attention to details:

- Translates text on selection or double click.
- Allows to select language to translate to (Ukrainian(default), English, German, Spanish, French). 
- Allows to add translation pair to your personal vocabulary.
- Shows your vocabulary in a pretty popup or in a separate tab.
- Gives possibility to manage your vocabulary (add / remove).
- Provides options, devtools (in development for now).

New amazing features are coming soon!

> Please note that the extension is not available to run on all pages as some sites prevent
content script injection, or API used for translation can be aborted due to site Content-Policy permissions.
